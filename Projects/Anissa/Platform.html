                <h1><strong>A STUDENT-RUN FUTURE</strong><br></h1>
                <p class="text-justify">As a prospective RPI undergraduate in the spring of 2016, the deciding factor for me to commit was the widely publicized campus protests advocating for a Student Run Future. It was abundantly clear that the Student Run Union of RPI is
                    key to the experiences and successes of the student body.&nbsp;<br><br>A Union at any institution is an integral part of the campus community that intends to foster and grow relationships between groups and to allow for students to
                    explore new interests. Our Union is constantly adapting to the needs of Rensselaer, including the addition of the mailroom, expansion of dining services, and reallocation of meeting spaces, but no amount of upgrades can provide the
                    invaluable experiences that a truly Student-Run Union can provide.&nbsp;<br><br>Previously the last Student-Run Union at a private institution in the country, we once served as a standard for student self-governance and student engagement.
                    Our student leaders continue to uphold the Union’s values but cannot truly thrive until there is evident trust and collaboration between Rensselaer’s administration and students. Decisions directly impacting students should be made
                    in collaboration with students. I believe that we can work with administration and alumni to restore a greater level of partnership and to allow for the future of Rensselaer to experience the potential of truly empowered students.&nbsp;<br><br>As
                    President of the Union, I will:<br><br><strong>I.</strong> Work to restore the Executive Board’s historical right to meaningful involvement at each step of the hiring process for Union administrative staff, including the Board’s right
                    and duty to approve new hirings;<br><strong>II.</strong> Call for the Institute to engage in open and honest dialogue with our students and alumni regarding the concerns raised by Renew Rensselaer, especially as they pertain to the
                    state and future of our Union;<br><strong>III.</strong> Restore and expand opportunities for the student body to participate in the Union’s budgeting process, including working with the Senate to restore the open presentation of the
                    activity fee recommendation before submission to the Board of Trustees;<br><br></p>
                <h1><strong>MEANINGFUL DIVERSITY &amp; INCLUSION</strong><br></h1>
                <p class="text-justify">The Rensselaer Union is the heart of campus, and as such, it houses numerous cultural and affinity organizations. The recent addition to the Executive Board’s committees, the Multicultural Leadership Council, was a crucial step forward
                    to advocate for multicultural clubs but there is still much to address with diversity at RPI.&nbsp; A Union is meant to be a comfortable and encouraging atmosphere for all students. This mindset should be constantly carried out by
                    the Union and its leaders through all facility, programming, and budgeting decisions.<br><br>As President of the Union I will:<br><strong>I.</strong>&nbsp;Advocate the need for a larger, permanent space dedicated to Multicultural programming,
                    culture, and community to the Administration;<br><strong>II.</strong>&nbsp;Collaborate with the Multicultural Leadership Council and the Business Operations Committee to complete renovations of the X Lounge and the creation of the
                    Lavender Lounge;<br><strong>III. </strong>Develop an application and criteria for Executive Board appointments to prioritize all forms of diversity and inclusivity;<br><strong>IV. </strong>Continue to work with multicultural groups
                    while developing and updating Union Budgeting Guidelines and Policies, especially those relating to cultural food and events;&nbsp;<br><strong>V.</strong> Work with the Institute to create a fair and unbiased policy that addresses
                    large campus events during high risk times to ensure that no organization’s event be singled out.<br><br></p>
                <h1><strong>FIRST-CLASS FACILITIES</strong><br></h1>
                <p class="text-justify">As the increasing freshman class sizes have hit a limit, the Executive Board now has a chance to evaluate and accommodate the new Rensselaer population. With several new projects finished (Union mailroom and Welcome lobby updates) and
                    others underway (Union Pub Expansion, XLounge/LGBTQ Lounge, and Ben &amp; Jerry’s relocation), the Union needs time to settle. While completing projects, I believe the Union should focus more on the long-term for major capital expenses,
                    especially planning for once the Union pays off its debt. In the short-term, the Executive Board should collaborate with students from all facets of RPI, including participants of the Arch, club members, and even those who just use
                    the Union to study, to address basic campus needs. As the heart and home of campus, the Union should be an accommodating and friendly place for everyone.<br><br>As President of the Union, I will:<br><br><strong>I.&nbsp;</strong>Work
                    to develop a plan for longterm Union updates, as the Union approaches paying off its loan from the 2001 facility updates in 2025;<br><strong>II.&nbsp;</strong>Develop a plan to increase dining and event space in the Rathskeller that
                    is desperately needed to address the influx of traffic at night as a result of the late night meal swipe conversions;&nbsp;<br><strong>III.&nbsp;</strong>Follow through with facilities updates approved in FY19 including updates to
                    the Union Clubhouse Pub, the moving of Ben &amp; Jerry’s, and Campus Unisex Barber.<br><br></p>
                <h1><strong>PRIORITIZING CLUBS</strong><br></h1>
                <p class="text-justify">Clubs and Organizations are the backbone of our Union. In any place of higher education, many things must come together in order for a student to grow academically as well as socially. Our clubs provide a key outlet for students and allow
                    students to thrive. All organizations contribute to Rensselaer and its students and it is the Union’s duty to support their initiatives.&nbsp;<br><br>As President of the Union, I will:<br><strong>I. </strong>Require club representatives
                    to meet with their SARPs at least once per month to ensure cohesion in supporting their clubs’ interests and priorities;<br><strong>II.&nbsp;</strong>Actively seek feedback from clubs and organization while developing and updating
                    Union Budgeting Guidelines and Policies;<br><strong>III.&nbsp;</strong>Ensure that the new Union website has club meeting and officer information that is easily accessible to the Rensselaer community;&nbsp;<br><strong>IV.</strong>                    Collaborate with the Union Systems Administrators and the administrative staff to provide a secure and consistent website as well as continual improvements to CMS, including locking submitted budgets.<br><br></p>
                <h1><strong>OPTIMAL BOARD PERFORMANCE</strong></h1>
                <p class="text-justify">As the chief financial and budgeting body of the Union, the Executive Board plays a major role in its functionality. With a Board maximized for efficiency, the Union can more attentively and accurately serve its students.&nbsp;<br><br>As
                    President of the Union, I will:<br><strong>I.&nbsp;</strong>Work with Student Activities Resource Persons to come up with a rotating schedule to attend Executive Board meetings so that all SARPs are up to date on current issues facing
                    clubs and to foster relationships between Board Members and their SARPs;<br><strong>II.&nbsp;</strong>Send meeting minutes from the previous meeting out to the Board and anyone on the eboard-notification@union.lists.rpi.edu open mailing
                    list to allow for more open communication to the RPI community;<br><strong>III.</strong>Implement several procedural changes to hold the Executive Board more accountable, including a simulated budgeting session during training;&nbsp;<br>Enforce
                    Robert's Rules of Order to allow the meetings operate as efficiently as possible<br></p>
