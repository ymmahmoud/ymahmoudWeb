                    with the 2018-2019 E-Board and Vice President for Board Operations with the 2019-2020 E-Board, I worked to implement many organizational and procedural changes. Several of these include adding committee reports, restructuring the officer
                    positions to allow for more growth opportunities and to maximize productivity, and enforcing the sub-committee structure.While serving as the Policies Committee Chairwoman, I worked diligently to uphold and implement new policies to
                    ensure that the clubs and students of the Rensselaer Union community are able to get the most out of what the Union has to offer. One of my major contributions in the role was creating a Conflict of Interest Policy to ensure that members
                    of the Executive Board and Union Administrative Staff remain unbiased while representing clubs and making financial decisions. I served on several different committees during my years on E-Board as well, including the Club Operations
                    Committee from its founding, where I helped several new clubs through the application process, and worked with the Business Operations Committee to redevelop the Room Reservation Policy.&nbsp;Aside from student government, I am also
                    a committed member of the Greek Community as a sister of Alpha Phi, serving in several Vice President positions as well as a Panhellenic Recruitment Counselor. I am also an active member of and the secretary of Phalanx Honor Society.&nbsp;I’m
                    running for President of the Union to leave behind opportunities and experiences for our student body to value from—be it from the award-winning clubs, teams, and organizations, from our athletics and wellness programming, from the
                    vast resources available, or simply the ability to learn invaluable leadership experience in a student-run environment. As PU, my fellow students will serve as my top priority as we carve the Union’s path for the future.<br><br><br></p>
